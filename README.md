# 60daysofudacity
This repository contains the daily updates made during the 60daysofudacity challenge. This was an initiative from the Secure and Private AI Challenge Scholarship program.


# DAY 1 [1.6%] | 60
Begin with the #60daysofudacity challenge, completed the following:

* Lesson3: Introducing Differential Privacy [completed]
* Read the Book The Algorithmic Foundations of Differential Privacy, section 1: The Promise of Differential Privacy [page: 5 â€“ 10].
* Working in the implementation of the project for the Lesson 3.

__What I learn:__
This was my first introduction to the field of Differential Privacy. As pointed out in the lectures, it is important to have a well defined framework, which allow us to define what is really to be private in the context of deep learning. Also, from the book, I can now see how the notion of privacy have been evolving. As with many field related in computer science, it is obvious to predict, that, in the future, the field will become more complex.

# DAY 2 [3.3%] | 60
 
* Implementation of the project 2 for the Lesson 3 completed.
* Added a plot for the project, where the data distribution can be compared using two databases.
* Taking a recap from Lesson 3.

__What I learn:__
This was a very interesting project, where we created a main database, containing a single feature with ones and zeros. Also, we implemented a function to create more databases from the main one, with one row missing per database (a total of 5000 dbs). I noticed how we select the probability distribution for the samples to be 50%. This give me the idea to plot the density distribution for the databases using different probabilities. In fact, I plot a standard DB with p = 0.5 against one with p = 0.7. This help me to understand how the probability parameter affected the creation of the databases.

__DAY 3 [5.0%] | 60__
* Beginning with Lesson 4: Evaluating the Privacy of a Function [videos 1 and 2]
* Working in the initial project for this lesson.

__What I learn:__
It is interesting to see how some simple arithmetic functions, like sums, can be used to guest the identity of an individual in a database. This of course, makes necessary to address such issues. In the following day I will continue watching the lectures.
