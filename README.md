This repository contains the daily updates made during the 60daysofudacity challenge. This was an initiative from the Secure and Private AI Challenge Scholarship program.


# DAY 1 [1.6%] | 60
Begin with the #60daysofudacity challenge, completed the following:

* Lesson3: Introducing Differential Privacy [completed]
* Read the Book The Algorithmic Foundations of Differential Privacy, section 1: The Promise of Differential Privacy [page: 5 â€“ 10].

__What I learn:__
This was my first introduction to the field of Differential Privacy. As pointed out in the lectures, it is important to have a well defined framework, which allow us to define what is really to be private in the context of deep learning. Also, from the book, I can now see how the notion of privacy have been evolving. As with many field related in computer science, it is obvious to predict, that, in the future, the field will become more complex.
